# AI POWERED CHESS
UCI-compatible chess game built from scratch in Python
## HOW WE BUILT IT
We built a chess game that two mode:

1.**Play with human**


 In this mode,we built a chess game using python with various classes to handle the gameplay.
 
 **Main class**
 This class ties different components and handles the overall game flow 
 like interacting with different classes like Board,Piece,Player etc

 
 **Dragger class**
 This class handles the drag-and-drop functionality of chess pieces

 
 **Square class**
 This class is responsible for representing an individual square on the chessboard 

 
 **Sound class**
 This class handles the sound when we move pieces on the chess board

 
 **Board class**
 This class responsibles for many functions :
  *Maintain the board structure 

  *Initialize pieces at the start of the game

  *Move and update pieces on the board during gameplay and check legal moves 

  *Handles special chess rules(castling,en passant,pawn promotion)

  
 **Game class**
 This class oversees the overall game flow and interaction with AI

 
 **Move class**
 This class checks legal moves in chess board 

  
 **Const class**

 
 This class handles the screen and size of the board  
 
 

2.**Play with AI**


 The AI mode uses the stockfish chess engine where we can set the difficulty level and play with chess engine according to difficulty level

## Challenges we faced 


Implementing  OOPs concepts and and integrating verious classes and functions

## What we are proud of


My chess game defeats all my team mates and my friends

## Future work
We will try to implement neural nets in our chess which would learn the moves the ai then train itself while playing
